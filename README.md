## 🎯 Description

**gutenBooks** is a responsive web App for users who would like to read free classical books on the go. Using the Gutendex API, we pull books from the Gutenberg Project epub database and display them using React Reader (powered by ePubJS).
</br>

The app allows you to filter your search by author / title or by topic, read the book directly or add it to your Bookshelf for later. There's also a Reviews section for you to keep track of your read books with star rating and review functionality.
</br>

This web app was build with React, MUI components, styled with SCSS, and deployed on Netlify.
